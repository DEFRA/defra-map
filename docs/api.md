# API reference

The **Flood Map** is a customizable mapping interface designed for specific use cases, with a focus on accessibility. It is provided as a high-level API that works in conjunction with the MapLibre API.

The `FloodMap` object represents an instance of a flood map on your page. It provides methods and properties that allow you to programmatically modify the flood map and trigger events as users interact with it.

You create an instance of a `FloodMap` by specifying a `container`, map `options`, and an optional `callback` in the constructor. The Flood Map is then initialized on the page and returns an instance of a `FloodMap` object.
